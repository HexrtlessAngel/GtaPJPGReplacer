# What the hell is this?

This tool replaces any GTA V photo/selfie with any picture you want (Yes you can use this to make your own modded profile picture on social club)

# How to...

1. Make sure the pic you want to use is 950 x 536 and make sure it is a .jpg file (Use any photo editor of choice, GIMP, PhotoShop, MS Paint, whatever idgaf lmao)
2. Put your .jpg file of choice in the directory of GtaPJPGReplacer executable
3. Grab any picture of choice from your gta save data "C:\Users\(USERNAME)\Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V\Profiles\(YOUR GAME PROFILE)\(Any file that starts with PGTA5)
4. Copy PGTA5 file of choice to the directory of GtaPJPGReplacer executable
5. Run the tool and press Enter/Return key
6. Copy/move the modified PGTA5 file back to you profile 
7. Start up GTA V an done (You can upload to social club if you want but I do suggest you be careful, R*/T2 don't really like these kind of things....)
